## Vision

Create more dream jobs for programmers.

## Mission

Enlist high-quality programmers and teams that want to work with long-term, healthy employments.

## Values

- **Loving** - Monadium shows love to our partners to get love back. Through love comes empathy, happiness, and respect.

- **Welcoming** - Monadium welcomes all forms of participation in our movement. We will share through open sourced code and documents. We will help people take part and pay it forward.

- **Wonderful** - Monadium delights our partners with high quality and playfulness Interactions require little effort and will not scream for attention when you need to do more important things.

- **Deliberate** - We don't ask for or give more than we need from our partners. We only seek contact to create value for our partners. Our partners must know why we act as we do through clear communication and by being restrictive with how we seek people's attention.
